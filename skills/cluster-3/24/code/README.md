# Code Readme

This program uses the sample code from the PWM Servo Control model (Skill 9). First I used 1000 Hz for the frequency that was suggested on the class site. Additionally on Lines 15 and 16 I changed the max pulsewidth to 1000 and the max intensity to 100. With everything else in the base program kept the same I only had to duplicate the for loop starting on line 46. I needed this because I needed to wrap back down to intensity 0. Sample video can be found in the report.
