## Summary

The program I wrote uses the uart_read_bytes for the toggle mode stage to instantly change the led to on/off. After pressing 's' the program switches to echo mode and uses the gets function to read in user input and then echo it back. Finally, the last mode changes the users input integer to a hex value.
