## Summary
In this skill my team and I utilized the examples from the Canvasjs to understand how to embed the data from the class site into our program.
We decided to read and write data from the stocks file for this skill. This data we then graphed using a bar and a line graph to compare and contrast the companies. Pictures of each graph can be seen below.
