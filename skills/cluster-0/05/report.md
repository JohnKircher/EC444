## Summary

In this skill assignment I installed the USB drivers from Adafruit. Followed all the steps on Espressif getting started guide to setup tools for the device and my operating system. Then after validating that the toolchain works I ran two programs: hello world and Blink. Screenshots from the programs running to the feather can be seen below.
