## Summary
In this skill I wired a thermistor to a 10k resistor. I used the probed thermistor which is waterproof for this skill. Utilizing the ADC channel and sample code again I wrote a program to convert and print out the temperature in celsius to the console. Sample video of my program running and the thermistor working can be found using the link below.
