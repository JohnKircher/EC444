## Summary
In this skill, we created a database using TingoDB. To test it, we needed to read each line of smoke.txt into a JSON object and then inserted each JSON object into a database collection smoke_db. Once the file was read, we ran a sample query on the database getting all the readings from the file. 

## Sketches and Photos
