## Summary

In this skill I utilized the PWM Servo Control program from skill9 and adjusted it for the LED. After changing the pulsewidth and max intensity values I duplicated the for loop in the program so that the intensity increase and then decreases. Sample video of the program working can be seen at the link below.
