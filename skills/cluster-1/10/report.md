## Summary

This skill reduces code from the GPIO task with the LEDs and the task with the alphanumeric display. Using code from both of these examples this program and circuit allows the user to visualize binary counting in both directions. Additionally the alphanumeric display provides a visual cue for the directions: 'UP' & 'DOWN'. A sample video of the circuit running can be seen below.
